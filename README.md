# omi-kits

This repository contains binary distributions for the
[omi](https://github.com/Microsoft/omi) repository. Only the latest
version of OMI should be checked into this repository at any one time.

This repository exists so older UNIX systems can easily get binary kits
of the OMI binaries in an automated way. Note that older UNIX systems do
not necessarily contain the `curl` or `wget` tools.
